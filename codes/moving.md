## Two pointers
### same
#### sliding window
- move right until not able to move; then move left
#### linked list - slow and fast pointer
#### two pointers from two lists
- merge two sorted lists
### face-to-face
#### quick sort
#### binary search
- anchor needed for making decision
## DFS
### two dimensional 
- row_down -> col_right
- backtracking -> update the results
- [combinations](backtracking/combinations.py)
- [permutations](backtracking/permutations.py)
### neighbor based
- check neighbors 
- [number of island](graph/number_of_islands.py)
## BFS
### neighbor based
- check neighbors
- set used to check loop 
- [course schedule](graph/course_schedule.py)
## Intevals
