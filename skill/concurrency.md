# Multiple Threads
## Condition Variable: 
### Examples:
- [Python](http://www.google.com)
- [C++](http://www.yahoo.com)
## Critical Section:
### CAS:
### Fine-Grained Locking:
### Read-Write Lock:
## Applications:
### Multiple Threads LRU Cache:
#### Efficiency Improvement:
* Fine-Grained locking: lock only the specific cache entries that are being accessed or modified by a thread, rather than locking the entire cache.
* Lock-free data structures (doubly linked list) rely on atomic operations provided by hardware or libraries: CAS (Compare-And-Swap) is a fundamental atomic operation used for updating values in a lock-free manner.
