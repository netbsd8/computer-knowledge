## flops
- FLOPS, which stands for "Floating Point Operations Per Second," is a measure of computer performance, especially in fields of scientific calculations that require floating-point calculations, which are calculations with real numbers that can have fractional parts. High FLOPS ratings often indicate the capability of the system to handle intensive computational tasks
