## Goldilocks problem
- The Goldilocks problem is a term used in computer science to describe the challenge of finding a solution or setting that is "just right" for a given problem or situation. The term is derived from the fairy tale of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, in which Goldilocks tries three bowls of porridge, one of which is too hot, one of which is too cold, and one of which is just right.

- In computer science, the Goldilocks problem can arise in many different contexts, such as system tuning, algorithm design, or user interface design. In each case, the challenge is to find the right balance between competing factors or constraints, such as performance, scalability, usability, and reliability.

- For example, in system tuning, the Goldilocks problem may involve finding the optimal values for various system parameters, such as buffer sizes, thread counts, or cache sizes. If these parameters are set too low, the system may not perform well under heavy load, but if they are set too high, the system may waste resources or become unstable.

- Similarly, in algorithm design, the Goldilocks problem may involve finding the right balance between time complexity and space complexity. If an algorithm uses too much memory, it may be impractical for large datasets, but if it uses too much CPU time, it may be too slow for real-time applications.

- Overall, the Goldilocks problem highlights the importance of balancing different factors and constraints in computer science and engineering, and of finding solutions that are optimized for a specific problem or situation.
## Interrupt coalescing
- Interrupt coalescing is a technique used in computer systems to reduce the number of interrupts generated by the hardware for each incoming event. Interrupts are signals that are generated by the hardware to notify the CPU that an event has occurred, such as the arrival of a packet in a network interface or the completion of a disk operation. Each interrupt requires a context switch to the kernel, which can be expensive in terms of processing time and system resources.
- Interrupt coalescing works by delaying the generation of interrupts until a certain number of events have occurred or a certain amount of time has elapsed. This allows the system to process multiple events with a single interrupt, reducing the overall number of interrupts and improving system performance.
- For example, in a network interface, interrupt coalescing can be used to group multiple incoming packets into a single interrupt, reducing the number of context switches required and improving overall network performance. In a storage system, interrupt coalescing can be used to group multiple disk operations into a single interrupt, reducing the overhead associated with managing individual disk operations.

## CPU utilization
- CPU utilization = (time in non-idle states / total time) * 100%
- The calculation of CPU utilization typically involves measuring the time spent in different CPU states, such as user mode, system mode, idle, and I/O wait, and then computing the percentage of time spent in non-idle states.

## CPU power
- In general, a higher CPU utilization can lead to higher CPU power consumption, as more power is required to execute instructions and perform computations. However, the relationship between CPU utilization and power consumption can be complex and nonlinear, as the power consumption may also depend on other factors such as the instruction mix, memory access patterns, and cache behavior.There is a relationship between CPU utilization and CPU power, but it is not a straightforward one. CPU power consumption is affected by many factors, including CPU utilization, clock frequency, voltage, temperature, and workload characteristics.
- Furthermore, modern CPUs often incorporate power management features such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), which can adjust the clock frequency and voltage of the CPU based on the workload and power constraints. This can allow the CPU to reduce its power consumption during periods of low utilization or idle time, and to increase its performance during periods of high utilization.

# Tool
## stress
- stress --cpu 4 --io 3 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 30s
  - This command will create stress on the CPU by running 4 threads, on the I/O by performing 3 I/O operations per second, and on the memory by using 2 instances of 128MB memory allocation. The stress will last for 30 seconds.
## DD
- dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/output bs=8k count=100k
